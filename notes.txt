pip freeze gives you a list of all packages and libraries installed.

A virtual environment gives you a clean installation of Python with no libraries.

Creation of virtual environments is done by executing the command venv:

python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate.

Deactivate venv
deactivate

Flask-RESTful helps us create a REST api.

We use postman for API testing.

Design then create.
